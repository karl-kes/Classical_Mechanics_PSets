# ECE 105: Classical Mechanics Problem Sets

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of practice problem sets (PS) and a WIP Solutions Manual designed for **ECE 105: Classical Mechanics**, a first-year, calculus-based engineering physics course at the University of Waterloo.

These materials were created to supplement the course and ensure thorough preparation for the final exam, focusing on both fundamental derivations and multi-concept application problems.

## Scope and Coverage

The problem sets are heavily inspired by the material and pedagogical style of Professor Forrest's ECE 105 course at the University of Waterloo. They are divided into six major units:

| Unit | Core Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PS 1: Kinematics** | 1D & 2D motion, Projectile motion, Relative velocity, Kinematic equation derivations. |
| **PS 2: Forces** | Newton's Laws, Free-body diagrams, Friction, Tension, Non-inertial frames. |
| **PS 3: Work, Energy, & Momentum** | Work-Energy Theorem, Potential Energy, Conservation of Energy, Impulse, Elastic and Inelastic Collisions. |
| **PS 4: Rotational Motion** | Rotational Kinematics, Moment of Inertia, Torque, Angular Momentum, Rolling motion. |
| **PS 5: Oscillation** | Simple Harmonic Motion, Initial Conditions, Simple and Physical Pendulums. |
| **PS 6: Travelling Waves** | 1D Wave Equation, Wave properties, Superposition, Standing Waves, Doppler Effect. |

## Structure and Key Features

To maximize the utility for students and instructors, the problem sets are structured with clear conceptual boundaries:

### 1. Core Exam Topics
Each problem set begins with problems directly covering core concepts and necessary derivations*expected to appear on a typical final examination. These problems are designed to be at the appropriate difficulty level for ECE 105.

### 2. Advanced and Optional Topics
Sections labeled **"Optional Topics"** are included for personal enrichment and advanced study. These problems explore concepts that are typically **beyond the direct scope** of the ECE 105 course but reinforce deeper mechanical principles (e.g., Damped/Driven Oscillation, Coupled Oscillators, Gyroscopic Precession, etc...

### 3. Solutions Manual
A comprehensive Solutions Manual is currently in the works, featuring detailed step-by-step derivations, calculations, and final numerical answers for every problem.

## Usage

Students preparing for an ECE 105 or similar first-year Classical Mechanics exam are encouraged to:
1. Attempt the problems in the Core Exam Topics section without notes to simulate exam conditions.
2. Compare results with the solutions.
3. Use the Optional Topics to explore further mechanical concepts or prepare for advanced courses.

## Contribution & Feedback

This resource was created by Karl Keshavarzi during his enrollment in the course.

I welcome feedback from students and instructors on the clarity, scope, and correctness of the problems and solutions. Please feel free to email me at **karl.keshavarzi@uwaterloo.ca** for further discussion.
